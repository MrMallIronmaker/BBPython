# BBPython
BBPython, short for Block-Based Python, is a work in progress. It is designed to be a GUI for first-time programmers.

Block-based languages provide automatic management of the syntax of the language, and so can allow users to more easily focus on the semantics.

I propose that beginning programmers will have an easier time transitioning from a block-based language to a text-based language if they begin to see the hallmarks of standard Python syntax and observe the transitions between block- and text-based forms.
